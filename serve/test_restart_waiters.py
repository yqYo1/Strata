"""#1012 (the old #792): requests waiting for the engine's control lines when the engine is restarted.

restart() runs StrataEngine.__init__ again; it used to make a new condition variable, lock, wait counter and wait
list while the waiters still held the old ones: they hung for good, or failed with `list.remove(x): x not in
list`.  The admission state is now kept across a restart.  A waiter either goes on with the new engine or ends
with a clean 503; never a hang, never a ValueError.  The fake engine of test_parallel runs behind the real
StrataEngine and Service.
