// include/strata/core/spec_prob.hpp - PROBABILISTIC DRAFT ACCEPTANCE (STRATA_SPEC_PROB=1, off by default).
//
// Speculative rejection sampling (Leviathan et al. / Chen et al.) for the MTP drafts of a SAMPLED request.  Under
// sampling the verify window used to accept a draft only when it EQUALS the token the target sampled for that row
// (exact match).  For a draft that is the head's argmax - a point mass - that is already the standard rule, but it
// throws away what the draft head knows: its whole distribution q.  Here the draft layer SAMPLES its draft d from q
// (its own Philox stream) and the verifier accepts d with probability min(1, p(d) / q(d)); on a reject it samples the
// replacement from the residual norm(max(0, p - q)).  The output token of every row is then distributed exactly as
// p, the target's chain (penalties -> top_k -> top_p -> min_p -> temperature), whatever q is.
//
//   p   the TARGET'S distribution at the row: the list the sampler really samples from, after penalties, top_k,
//       top_p, min_p and temperature, renormalised.  At most 64 entries (kSelMax).  NOT the raw softmax: using it
//       would accept tokens the chain never emits (the llama.cpp #29924 class of bug).
//   q   the DRAFTER'S distribution: the same chain over the draft head's logits, with the drafter's own top_k /
//       top_p cut (each list is cut by its own rule - q never borrows p's cut).  A sparse list of at most 64
//       (id, probability) pairs, probabilities summing to 1.
//
// "NO q MEANS POINT MASS, NEVER q = 0."  A drafter without a candidate list (prompt lookup, suffix drafts, the
// lookup chain) proposes one token for sure: q is a delta at d, the accept probability is p(d) and the residual is p
// with d removed.  Treating "no list" as q = 0 would reject every such draft (llama.cpp #29924).  The engine only
// builds q lists for the MTP drafts; every other row of a window is a point-mass row.
//
// THE VERIFY ROWS ARE INDEPENDENT.  Row t of a window at pos0 judges draft t (token t + 1 of the window) with its
// own uniforms, three disjoint Philox counter spaces keyed by the row's position pos0 + t:
//     u_pick   counter = pos          the plain sample (the window's last row: the bonus token, and every row of a
//                                     window with no draft) - the same draw the exact-match sampler uses
//     u_accept counter = pos | 1<<62  accept / reject
//     u_resid  counter = pos | 1<<63  the residual sample after a reject
//     (the drafter's own draw: counter = pos | 1<<61)
// Row t writes out[t] = d when it accepts, and the residual sample (never d) when it rejects, so the host's
// unchanged loop `while (a < T-1 && window[a+1] == out[a]) ++a` takes exactly the accepted prefix, and out[a] is
// the bonus token.  Rows after the first reject are computed and ignored.
