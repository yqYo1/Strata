// include/strata/platform/memory.hpp - plan v0.3 P0.1/P1: keep a large host region resident.
//
// `cudaHostRegister` refuses the 31.6 GiB expert arena on Windows, and an unlocked arena is trimmed under memory
// pressure (the CPU pool then swung 2x between runs). With the n-gram table out of RAM there is headroom to lock
// it instead: raise the process's minimum working set by the region's size, then VirtualLock it (Windows needs
// only SeIncreaseWorkingSetPrivilege, which ordinary accounts hold). Linux: mlock.
