// T tokens at consecutive positions p0 .. p0+T-1 - the last accepted token and T-1 drafts - go through all 48
// layers in ONE captured graph, and the head's argmax is produced for every one of them.  Token t's argmax is
// what plain greedy decode would produce after token t, BIT FOR BIT: every kernel here is either the single-token
// kernel applied per token, or a multi-token kernel whose per-token arithmetic is the single-token kernel's
// (multi-column MMVQ in exact mode, the T-token GDN kernels, the per-token hit activation, the multi-token CPU
// expert rows).  So a draft is accepted exactly when greedy decode would have produced it.
//
// What the window costs is the dense weights read ONCE for T tokens and the union of the T tokens' missed
// experts on the CPU (measured on decode traces: 1.75x one token's misses for T=2, 2.4x for 3, 3.05x for 4).
//
// STATE.  The window appends K/V and indexer keys for all T positions and leaves the GDN state untouched.
// `commit(n_keep)` then makes the first `n_keep` tokens permanent: the GDN conv history and recurrent state are
// advanced by replaying those tokens from inputs the window stored, the indexer's key tail is restored from a
// snapshot and the accepted keys re-appended (a rejected key can land in a slot the current block still needs),
// and the PLE history is set to its snapshot after token n_keep-1.  K/V cells past the accepted prefix are simply
// overwritten when those positions are processed again, before any query can read them.
//
// Requires the default native decode configuration (native projections, fused GR, fused GDN, fast attention and
// selection, native indexer) and a profile-filled VRAM expert tier with its residency table on the device.
